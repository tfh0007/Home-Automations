# About This Project
- A collection of scripts that control logic and allow for custom automations in a home environment
- Was originally designed as a way of assisting my Grandmother to have easier control over her house in addition to having added security with alerts and warnings in the event of trouble
- The project was later expanded with a seprate Hub to control an apartment
- The logic was written using webCoRE
- The Hub that controls the automations is the Samsung Smartthings Hub which is combined with Google Assistant, Amazon alexa, Apple home kit, amoung other API's

## What was learned
- Learned more about how simple inbedded devices communicate with each other
- Learned more about gathering and responding to signals from an interconnected range of devices
- Gathered expanded knowledge of how IOT (internet of things) devices operate
- Had to use critical thinking to solve issues and engineer solutions
- Had to use extensive debugging to find and correct mistakes while many different signals were competing for the same resources
